                    <h2>Journey</h2>
                    <p>His journey to the world of IT was never 100% set in stone. As a little kid, he loved to dissassemble and assemble things back. although the dissasembly part was usualy an accidental breaking on his part. As a bit older individual, he turned his interest to nursing. Helping people and, in the future,making less money than tram driver. Untill one day, when he met people will turn his life around. That is it.</p>

                    <p>He sometimes does not know what to write when he has to. Just as in this section, he is writing something to fill the space that is needed to be filled. 
                        Who knows, maybe someone even reads this text until the end. If you read it, you are awesome. If you did not read it, you are just like me, no patience at all.</p>

                    <p>Product management appeared in his life out of nowhere. It made him realise that he could do things he actualy like, and not do things he thinks he wants to. It will be a hard and exhausting journey, but in the end, it will be worth it. </p>
